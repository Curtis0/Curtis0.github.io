           <!-- Hello everyone and welcome to my ePortfolio. Here you will find my goals in life as well as the best academic works I have accomplished during my student career.

   Please take a look at my "Goals and Outcomes" page for my goals in life and for my goals in my student career. In the "Coursework" page you will find my best academic work.

   "Outside the Classroom" contains information about extra-curricular activities I have done. This includes things I have done in leadership positions, church activities, my career and other activities that have helped me learn and grow as an individual outside of the classroom.

   Last but not by any means least is my resume. Please refer to the "Resume" page for an updated version of my resume.



   About Me - My name is Seiya. I am a Half-Japanese Half-American guy. I was born in Hiroshima, Japan and have lived in the United States for nearly my whole life. I am currently majoring in General Studies, however I really want to get into studying Organizational Behavior with a side in a numbers field such as Statistics or Math.
Favorite Music - I enjoy listening to some Brian Adams, Ryan Shupe, Classical music, and lots of other great 80's and 90's music.
     I also enjoy listening to Japanese music. Some of the rather popular bands I like to listen to are Ketsumeishi, Greeeen, Kiroro, and the list continues...
Good Novels - The Narnia series by C.S. Lewis, the Redwall series by Brian Jacques, and The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien.
Hobbies - My hobbies are to spend time with my wife, to eat good food, to read a good book, to play chess, and to take pictures, particularly of small animals, insects and flowers. -->
